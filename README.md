# SEVEYANOCHKA BACKEND

My name is Matvey and this is my backend for pet-project

## About backend

I developed this backend based on YouTube videos. I am not a backend developer so the quality of the code is not the best.

### Difficulties

The backend turned out to be quite difficult for me, which is not surprising, because I studied frontend development.
Therefore, it was a lot of difficulty for me to make a backend that would somehow work.

### What I learned while developing this project

I learned how to run a server on express.js; learned how file sharing happens (routes, controllers and services); learned how to handle errors; learned how to use middleware layers

## How to start

For an application to work, you need a frontend, a backend, and a database.

To make it easier for you to start my project, I made a docker compose file, which is placed in the github [repository](https://github.com/f1le47/severyanochka-docker). In the README.md file I described what needs to be done to start the project.
